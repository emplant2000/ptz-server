// this is what I reverse engineered
first four bits are the top buttons
trigger = 1
left button = 2
top right = 4
bottom right = 8

next four bits are the nine positions of the hat
0-8 up-nothing

next 8 bits are the least significant bits of the 10 bit X axis (signed)
next 6 bits are the least significant bits of the 10 bit Y axis (signed)
next 2 bits are the most significant bits of the X axis
next 4 bits are the least significant bits of the 6 bit Z axis (signed)
next 4 bits are the most significant bits of the Y axis
next 6 bits are used for buttons
next 2 bits are used for the most significant bits of the Z axis

it works like this:
byte 3 - cdef----
byte 4 - ------ab
final value - abcdef as a six bit signed value

sample code:
    let sign = data[4] << 4;
    let val = data[3] >> 4;
    let final = sign | val;
    // six bit signed 2s complement
    final = unsigned2signed(final, 6);
    console.log(sign.toString(2), val.toString(2), final.toString(2), final);


next 4 bits are buttons c, d, arrow
next 4 bits are complicated
bit 0 is z axis turned to the right but also when slightly to the left
bit 1 is z axis turned to the left at all
bit 2 is button A
bit 3 is button B

next 8 bits are the dial but only 7 bits are used
when centered, the value is 00
it's value is a 7 bit 2s complement signed integer
it increments when moving counter-clockwise
-64 â€“ 63

represented as a signed 7 bit integer
incrementing when moving counterclockwise
